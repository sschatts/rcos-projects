RCOS Projects Assignment
======================================

Hello RCOS member!

In this assignment, you'll be practicing contributing to an open-source repository with the "fork & pull" model.

Your task is to create a pull request into your project's folder (creating your project folder if it doesn't already exist) and adding your name (and an optional descriptor) to a `members.txt` file (again, create this if it doesn't exist). Everyone must submit their own pull request to get credit.

Then, submit a pull request to this repository so that a project maintainer can add your changes to the repo.

For inspiration, check out all the [merged pull requests](https://github.com/rcos/rcos-projects/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)

If you need help, check out this [helpful tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) from Github, or contact your mentor.

Good luck!
